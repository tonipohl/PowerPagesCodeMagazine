Power Pages enable organizations to create public-facing websites or portals that can be used for data access, forms, and internal tasks (and for external audiences such as customers, vendors, partners, and employees). Such portals can be developed as solutions for a variety of purposes, such as providing self-service support, allowing customers to track orders or submit requests, or providing a platform for employee collaboration and communication. shows an example of a website built with Power Pages that facilitates event registration.
